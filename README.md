# vnStat Alert

## What is it?

This is a simple python script to control data usage by shutting down the machine when a set limit is reached and sends an email alert to the admin.

## Current Version

- Version 3.0
- Released 07/05/2016

## Requirements

- vnStat

## vnStat Configuration

1. Edit `/etc/vnstat.conf`
  - Change `MonthRotate` on line 10 to start date of billing period (1-28)
2. Setup vnStat monitoring
  - `sudo vnstat -u -i eth0`
    - Replace eth0 with network interface to be monitored, the command `vnstat --iflist` will show all available network interfaces
3. Start the vnStat daemon and set to run on boot
  - `sudo vnstatd -d`
  - Add `vnstat -d` above `exit 0` line in `/etc/rc.local`

## Script Configuration

1. Change the number on Line 7 to the usage limit in GB (whole numbers only)
2. Add script to `crontab` to run automatically
  - Add `5 * * * * /path/to/script.py` to root crontab (`sudo crontab -e`)
    - Replace the 5 with how often you want the script to check usage in minutes
    - Replace `/path/to/script.py` with the actual path to the script (obviously)

## Comments

- Update and addition of conversion code is because vnStat uses GiB (gibibyte) rather than GB (gigabyte) and 1 GiB is more than 1 GB

## Changelog

### Version 2.0

- Completely changed how script retrieves usage data

### Version 2.1

- Added conversion from GB to GiB within the script for more accuracy
- Added units checking for MiB and GiB

### Version 3.0

- Cleanup and new README
- Email capable version of script added
